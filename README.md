# 👋 Hi, I'm Pongsagorn (Bass) 💻

I'm a data science student passionate about using AI to solve healthcare challenges. 🏥  My current skills include:

- Programming: Python 🐍
- Machine Learning: TensorFlow 🧠
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn (or other libraries you use) 📊 

Projects I'm Interested In:

- Disease prediction models: Developing algorithms to predict the onset or progression of diseases based on patient data. 🔮
- Medical image analysis: Using deep learning techniques to analyze medical images (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs) for diagnosis or disease tracking. 🔬
- Healthcare data optimization: Applying machine learning to streamline healthcare processes, improve resource allocation, and enhance patient outcomes. 🚀

How to Collaborate:

I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals and teams working on AI for healthcare projects. Please reach out if you:

- Have a project in mind 🤔
- Would like to brainstorm ideas 💡
- Want to team up on a solution 🤝

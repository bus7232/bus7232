# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Pongsagorn (Bass)

I'm a data science student passionate about using AI to solve healthcare challenges.  My current skills include:

-- Programming: Python
-- Machine Learning: TensorFlow
-- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn (or other libraries you use) 

Projects I'm Interested In:

-- Disease prediction models: Developing algorithms to predict the onset or progression of diseases based on patient data.
-- Medical image analysis: Using deep learning techniques to analyze medical images (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs) for diagnosis or disease tracking.
-- Healthcare data optimization: Applying machine learning to streamline healthcare processes, improve resource allocation, and enhance patient outcomes.

How to Collaborate:

I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals and teams working on AI for healthcare projects. Please reach out if you:

-- Have a project in mind
-- Would like to brainstorm ideas
-- Want to team up on a solution
